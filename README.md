## Skills

Problem solving - One of my key strengths is my ability to find solutions and deal with pressure. I believe that both these qualities tie in together as it is important to be able to keep a clear head and maintain clarity when faced with a difficult situation. I have overcome some challenging times in my life and I am proud of how I have dealt with them. Battling with my mental health as a young adult and learning how to overcome this situation has played a huge role in the adult I have become today. Overcoming these issues with effective therapy techniques and self improvement with exercise and travel have given me a strong resolve and a personal belief that I can overcome any challenge that I am faced with today. This part of my life has taught me compassion and that no problem is insurmountable. Furthermore my wide range of jobs, working with many different cultures and within many different team structures has exposed me to a lot of different ways of thinking and this has further developed these skills. 

Flexibility to work autonomously or as part of a complex team -  The company I worked for in Melbourne was the sole supplier of furniture for the Australian Open in 2019. This was a huge undertaking for our company, we faced many deadlines and complex logistical challenges that required the collaboration of many departments within the company to overcome. I played a key role as a team member on site helping to liaise with clients and finding solutions to any problems that arose. As a team member I would help wherever I was needed most, be it on site, in the warehouse, or in logistics. Seeing this project through successfully was an incredibly rewarding experience. It taught me vital lessons about the importance of effective communication and planning, I also learnt valuable lessons about the power of efficient delegation and the impact that this can have in time sensitive projects.
